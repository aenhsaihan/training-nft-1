# :wine_glass: Wine marketplace

We are going to build a Wine marketplace.
You can play with the final demo here : [https://demo.winefactory.marigold.dev/](https://demo.winefactory.marigold.dev/)

Plan of the training course :

- NFT 1 : use FA2 nft template to understand the basics
- NFT 2 : finish FA2 nft complete marketplace
- NFT 3 : use FA2 single asset template to build another kind of marketplace
- NFT 4 : use FA2 multi asset template to build last complex kind of marketplace

## :performing_arts: What are NFTs?

A non-fungible token is a unique and non-interchangeable unit of data stored on a digital ledger. NFTs can be used to represent easily-reproducible items such as photos, videos, audio, and other types of digital files as unique items, and use blockchain technology to establish a verified and public proof of ownership.

## :open_file_folder: What is IPFS?

The InterPlanetary File System is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS uses content-addressing to uniquely identify each file in a global namespace connecting all computing devices. In this tutorial, we will be using [pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) to store the metadata for NFTs.

## :scroll: Smart Contracts

We will use two contracts for the marketplace. First will be the token contract. On Tezos FA2 is the standard for Non-fungible Token contracts. We will be using the template provided by Ligo to build out the Token Contract. The template contains the basic entry points for building a Fungible or Non-fungible token including

- Transfer
- Balance_of
- Update_operators

On a second time, we will import this contract into a second one that will be the marketplace unique contract. This contract will bring missing feature as :

- Mint
- Buy
- Sell
